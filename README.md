# JoshTFlickr
JoshFlickr is a simple app created to demonstrate the implementation of Flickr API, where you can search your desired topic and on its click
you can see the details about your searched topic. 
I have used an open API for the same. You can find more information about API's in Flickr Documentation : https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/
